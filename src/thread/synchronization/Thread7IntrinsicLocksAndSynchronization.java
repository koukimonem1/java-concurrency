//enforcing exclusive access to an object's state and establishing happens-before relationships that are essential to visibility
//Synchronization is built around an internal entity known as the intrinsic lock or monitor lock. (The API specification often refers to this entity simply as a "monitor.")
//Intrinsic locks play a role in both aspects of synchronization: enforcing exclusive access to an object's state and establishing happens-before relationships that are essential to visibility.
//Every object has an intrinsic lock associated with it
//A thread is said to own the intrinsic lock between the time it has acquired the lock and released the lock
//As long as a thread owns an intrinsic lock, no other thread can acquire the same lock. The other thread will block when it attempts to acquire the lock.
// When a thread releases an intrinsic lock, a happens-before relationship is established between that action and any subsequent acquisition of the same lock.
